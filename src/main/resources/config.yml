# Discord commands mode options
#
#  - MESSAGE → Players can use commands by typing them as normal
#              Discord messages in the "chat-channel-id".
#              Example: "playerlist"
#
#  - SLASH   → Commands are registered as Discord slash commands.
#              Example: "/playerlist"
#
#  - BOTH    → Allows using both message commands and slash commands.
#
#              IMPORTANT!!!!!!
#              When using SLASH mode (or BOTH), this plugin will
#              push its commands to Discord via the REST API.
#              This will REMOVE any existing slash commands on
#              your bot, leaving only the ones from this plugin.
